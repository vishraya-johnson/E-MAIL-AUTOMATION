SENDING APPROVALS USING RPA


Our primary objective in this Robotic Process Automation (RPA) project is to automate the approval process for form responses. 
The workflow is triggered automatically when a new form response is submitted, initiating a sequential approval process involving three approvers.

Key Features:

Automated Trigger: The approval process is initiated automatically upon the submission of a new form response.

Sequential Approval: The request must pass through three levels of approvers.

First Approver: The process begins with the first approver, who must either accept or reject the request.

Conditional Flow:

If the first approver accepts, the request moves to the second approver.

If the first approver rejects, a rejection email is sent to the responder, including the stage details and the approver's comments.

Cancelable Approval: The approval process can be canceled at any stage before completion.

Detailed Notifications: The responder receives detailed notifications regarding the status of their request, including any comments from the approvers.

This project ensures a streamlined and efficient approval process, minimizing manual intervention and reducing turnaround time for form responses.
